So it seems this code breaks down my .mdx file into JSON-LD which to my understanding is just an easier to read JSON format.

It reads my text literally, so I don't have to do any "\n" nonsense.

## I can also do headers

I seem to also be able to write code in different languages, for example, here's python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n==0:
        return 0
    if n==1:
        return 1
    return fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2)

```

## In Conclusion
This is pretty interesting, and I may post more if I feel like it. Overall it's just fun to look at stuff like this.
